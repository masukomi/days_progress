# Contributing to days_progress

## Filing an issue or feature request

Just [add a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/masukomi/days_progress/issues).

## Code Changes

Want to improve the code? That's awesome. In generall I'll merge
any bug fix, code cleanup, or unit test improvement. 

With regards to new features: if it's a minor iteration on what's
there, or something that allows users more abilities to configure
the look I'm all for it. If it's something significant, please
file an issue first proposing the change.

Once you've made your change, be sure to run the test suite and
confirm that everything still passes. If you've added features,
please be sure to add tests to guarantee they keep working.


```sh
$ ./test.scm
```
